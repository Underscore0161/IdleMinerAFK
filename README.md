# IdleMinerAFK
Discord Idle Miner AFK script

To make the script work you MUST
1. Open the "imports.py" file to install all the imports that the script runs on (keyboard,datetime)
2. Open the "idleminerafk.py" and open discord and click on the type bar in the server that the idle miner bot is installed

(You have 10 seconds to click on the type bar)

The script will now type all commands for you for the next few hours (including rebirth every so often)

Feel free to edit or change the python file in any way its a simple file and great for if you are looking to learn about how python can autmate tasks for you


Enjoy,

(Using scripts/bots to make the idle miner bot AFK is against the rules. I am not responsible for your actions, use this at your own risk)
